**_Turn a Celeron NUC into a modern cloud computing solution for your home._**

With a NUC, some RAM and an SSD, you can:
* Replicate personal files between your various devices using Nextcloud storage.
* Create a media library and make it availble to your home entertainment system through Samba shares.
* Create your own DNS infrastructure and block invasive marketing with pihole DNS.
* Centralize your account and passwords for any applications that support OpenLDAP.
* Secure your services and network traffic with SSL certificates and keep The Man out of your business.
* Stash all your nerdy code repositories locally using a Gitea git server.

Spend your time using the system, not building it.
* Shell scripts take care of installation and configuration details.
* Docker containers let you deploy new applications quickly.

Start by [installing the Alpine Linux OS](00_Alpine.md) onto your NUC.
